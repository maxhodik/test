It doesn't hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh
